___ON SERVER SIDE___

    --to show default data on homepage data in (constants folder-->data.js)
    which will be imported in 
    (default.js--> to insert default data into database written seperately because there is no api call for it. it just to store default data)

  Model -->before insering the data into database we need to validate it like do we have tthe required fields and stuffs.(for that we use models )

        i. Login Dialog(use dialog component of material ui);
        ii. Signup Dialog-->
            Enter details like (name,email, username,password)
        {note - for that we use text field and call a same function to each field but to differentiate the differernt filelds we use (name attribute) }
        
        call an backend API to signup

Redux --> here we used to store the states in frontend itself in a centralised repository/database which is called redux;
